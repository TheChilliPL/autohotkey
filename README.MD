# AutoHotKey scripts

This repository contains a collection of AutoHotKey scripts, which are small 
programs that can automate repetitive tasks, remap keys, and perform other 
customizations on your Windows PC. AutoHotKey is a free, open-source scripting 
language for Windows that is easy to learn and use.

## HitmanQuickSave

Current version: v1.0 (last updated: 2023-02-15)

A simple script that lets you quickly save and load the first manual save slot
in HITMAN: World of Assassination (previously: HITMAN 3).

# How to run

First, you need to get [AutoHotKey]. My current scripts all require version 2
of AutoHotKey, so make sure you're downloading the right thing.  
After installing AutoHotKey, you should be able to run the script just like any
executable on your PC, by double-clicking it.  
Make sure to read the script header first, as it might give you some additional
clues. For example, some features might require you to run the script with
administrator privileges.
